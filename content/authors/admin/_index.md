I am a MSc research assistant at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/) in the [Robotics Innovation Center (RIC)](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/de/startseite.html), Germany. 

I work for the [DeeperSense Project](https://www.deepersense.eu/www/), I am in charge of working with underwater sensors for the collection, processing and labeling of real-life underwater image data. I also design and implement neural networks to improve the perception of underwater systems as well as explore the potential of multi-modal and self-supervised learning for further improvements. 

My main interest is to provide solutions to real-life problems through science. Broadly speaking my research spans the fields of computer vision, machine & deep learning, generative modeling, multi-modal & self-supervised learning, with a focus on improving the perception capacities of autonomous systems.
