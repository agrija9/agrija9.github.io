I am a machine learning research assistant at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/) in the [Robotics Innovation Center (RIC)](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/de/startseite.html), Germany. I work for the [DeeperSense Project](https://www.deepersense.eu/www/), where I design and implement neural networks to improve the perception of underwater systems using multi-modal and self-supervised learning approaches.

<!--My main interest is to provide solutions to real-life problems through science.-->
<!--My research spans the fields of computer vision, generative modeling, machine & deep learning, robotics, with a focus on improving the perception capacities of autonomous systems.-->
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, deep learning, and statistical modeling with applications to computer vision, autonomous navigation, and robotics.

I obtained my M.Sc. in [Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) from Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (Germany) in December 2021. During my studies, I worked as a research assistant at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)](https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en.html). I have a BSc in Physics from [Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (Mexico)](http://www.uabc.mx/), I wrote my thesis at the [National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB)](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html) in the field of [Trapped-Ion Quantum Engineering](https://www.quantummetrology.de/equopt/home/).
