I am a machine learning engineer at Epirus in Torrance, California. I am in charge of the design, implementation and testing of neural networks for FPGA systems with applications to microwave technologies.

I obtained my M.Sc. in [Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) from the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (Germany) in December 2021. During and after my master studies I was a machine learning research assistant at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/) in the [Robotics Innovation Center (RIC)](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/de/startseite.html). I also worked as a machine learning research assistant at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)](https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en.html). I have a B.Sc. in Physics from [Universidad Autonoma de Baja California (Mexico)](http://www.uabc.mx/), I wrote my B.Sc. thesis at the [National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB)](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html) in the field of [Trapped-Ion Quantum Engineering](https://www.quantummetrology.de/equopt/home/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, deep learning, and statistical modeling with applications to computer vision, autonomous navigation, and robotics.
